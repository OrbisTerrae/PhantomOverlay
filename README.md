Use SRT generated file from DJI drones to overlay GPS data on video

https://sites.google.com/site/oterrae/phantom-overlay


This app allows you to take advantage of the SRT file generated by your DJI drone (Phantom, Mavic), to overlay GPS data in three ways:

- GPX - convert the SRT generated data into a GPS Garmin compatible file (to be used with VIRB edit for example).
- KML - to display the flight of your Phantom on Google Earth
- FCPXML - to import the recorded data into Final Cut Pro X

Download Phantom Overlay v1.1.1 for Mac - Beta version (Release notes)

Please note that the SRT data are recorded at 1s interval, with a minimum resolution of 11 meters, so don't expect any precise GPS info.

To use the app, simply drag and drop the SRT phantom file into it, and choose the output format.
The generated files are recorded in the same directory as the source.
